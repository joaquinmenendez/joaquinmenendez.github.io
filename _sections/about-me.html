<p>I studied and worked as a lecturer and research assistant at the University of Buenos Aires. During those years, I gained exposure to different fields such as experimental design, behavior analysis, and neuroscience. Throughout this fascinating journey, I realized that I needed more sophisticated tools to properly address such a complex topic as human behavior. Eager by this curiosity, I decided to enroll at Duke to improve my abilities in programming, machine learning, and statistical modeling.

I am interested in using data science as a tool to understand and resolve problems in healthcare, and at the same time, to produce a social impact on people's lives. </p>
